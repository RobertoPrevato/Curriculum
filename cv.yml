profile:
  - >
    I am a specialist of web applications, with deep understanding of HTTP web servers, clients, frameworks, and browsers.
    I have a generalist profile, with more than 10 years of experience in building back-ends and front-ends.
    Web development and coding are two of my greatest passions, and I think this is demonstrated by my <a href="https://github.com/RobertoPrevato">GitHub profile</a>
    and employment history.

  - >
    I am the author of one of today's most performant web frameworks for Python: BlackSheep; proved by TechEmpower benchmarks
    even when its first version included the implementation of an HTTP Server.
    This gave me the opportunity to work with Łukasz Langa (former Python release manager and Python Core Developer) and Yury Selivanov (also Python Core developer),
    in EdgeDB. The adventure in EdgeDB lasted only 8 months, in 2020, for the only reason that I have a family and couldn't adapt to working in a small start-up
    with 9 hours of time difference. I didn't like doing daily meetings starting at 7 PM, even though I liked the atmosphere in EdgeDB.
    Good performance in my web framework is achieved using C extensions for Python, and libraries written in C for CPU intensive operations.

    - >
    I am currently working in Demant, which is one of the two leading companies in hearing healthcare,
    as Senior Cloud Developer, and transitioning to a Cloud Architect position.
    My main responsibilities at work consist in building back-ends in Azure Cloud, help defining the global governance for our production services,
    and best practices to implement, secure, and publish APIs.
    For Demant in the last 4 years I also built a few single page applications (SPAs), including a software distribution platform for Oticon Medical,
    integrated with both Azure Active Directory and Azure Active Directory B2C, and a portal to handle CIAM information (Customer Identity and Access Management).

  - >
    When building back-ends at work, I code mainly with C# and Microsoft technologies. When coding in the free time,
    my favorite programming language is Python and my platform of choice is Ubuntu.

  - >
    When creating new front-ends, I build single page applications. My technology of choice today is React with TypeScript, and WebPack. In the past I also
    used Angular, Vue.js, Knockout.js, Ember, Backbone with Require.js, and before Node.js was first published in 2012, I was already building front-ends using
    jQuery and plain JavaScript.

  - >
    The reason why I live in Poland is that I was hired from Italy to work on the new internet banking of mBank. I was hired by Accenture and Avanade because I
    created a Tetris web application in HTML and JavaScript, and I was already well proficient with front-ends.

desired_position: >-
  Cloud Architect or System Architect. Contributing to APIs, DevOps, and Cloud governance.
  Possibility to work with my favorite technologies: Azure, Python, C#, TypeScript.

projects:
  - name: BlackSheep
    description: Asynchronous web framework to build event based, non-blocking Python web applications. It is inspired by Flask, ASP.NET Core, and the work by Yury Selivanov. BlackSheep includes a web framework and an implementation of HTTP client, and is ASGI compatible. Originally it included an implementation of HTTP Server, and performed well in the last round of benchmarks from TechEmpower. However, the decision of separating the web framework and making it compatible with ASGI servers is a good one, as it enables focusing on relatively high level features. Two project templates, for MVC architecture and empty APIs, are provided in dedicated repositories.
