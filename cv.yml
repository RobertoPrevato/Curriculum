  - >
    I currently work as a **Cloud Solution Architect** in the **Cloud Center of
    Excellence** team at **Demant**, a role I was promoted to in February 2022 after
    serving as **Senior DevOps** and **Senior Cloud Developer**. In Demant, which is one
    of the two leading companies in hearing healthcare, I am responsible for overall
    governance of the **Azure tenant**, serving as the final authority on architectural
    and governance decisions. I am also one of the main administrators of Demant's
    **Azure DevOps** organizations and **GitHub Enterprise** account. In August 2023 I
    personally configured the integration between our **Entra ID** tenant and Demant's
    **GitHub Enterprise Managed Users** account and assigned the first GitHub Copilot
    Seats. In recent years, I have played a crucial role in implementing **Azure landing
    zones** at Demant, contributing directly to the related automation. I have played a
    key role in defining Demant's **Internal Developer Platform** and **Platform
    Engineering** strategy, contributing to the design of features to enable development teams to
    provision and manage resources independently. I am a key contributor in implementing
    a **Cloud Community of Practice** in Demant, working on documentation and knowledge
    sharing. For example, I produced documentation and examples to describe a
    recommended strategy for automating deployments to **Azure API Management**. I
    regularly work on **Infrastructure as Code** using **YAML Pipelines**, **Bash**,
    **Azure CLI**, and **PowerShell**.

    Before my promotion to the Cloud Architect position, I worked on several web
    applications (both front-ends and back-ends) and web APIs for Demant,
    often independently implementing web applications end-to-end. Examples of IT systems
    I developed for Demant using Azure include: the **Signing Service API**
    (**GxP validated**), which is used to create and verify digital signatures for firmware
    at Demant's production sites for hearing devices; the **Oticon Medical Software
    Center**, a software distribution platform for Oticon Medical integrated with both
    **Azure Active Directory** (now Entra ID) and **Azure AD B2C**; and **HIQMS** (**GxP validated**), a
    system used to store and share documents for our **QMS (Quality Management System)**. I
    also built a portal to handle **CIAM** (Customer Identity and Access
    Management) for hearing care professionals (project name: **Demant Admin Tool**), web
    APIs to serve localized content for mobile apps used by end customers (project name:
    **Account WebFace**).

    I am a specialist in **web applications**, with a deep understanding of **HTTP web servers**,
    clients, **web frameworks**, and browsers. I have a generalist profile, with more than **10
    years of experience** in building back-ends and front-ends. **Web development** and **coding**
    are two of my greatest passions, as demonstrated by my <a
    href="https://github.com/RobertoPrevato">GitHub profile</a> and employment history.

    I am the author of one of today's **most performant web frameworks for Python**: <a
    href="https://github.com/Neoteroi/BlackSheep">**BlackSheep**</a>, as proven by **TechEmpower
    benchmarks** since its first implementations. This gave me the opportunity to
    work part-time with **Łukasz Langa** (former Python release manager and Python Core
    Developer) and **Yury Selivanov** (also a Python Core developer) at **EdgeDB**. The position
    at EdgeDB lasted only 8 months, in 2020, while I was still working full-time for Demant.

  - >
    During my work at EdgeDB I implemented a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA) bot**
    for GitHub, which is now also used by the **Python Software Foundation**. The source
    code is available on GitHub in the EdgeDB organization. The adoption of the CLA bot by
    the Python Software Foundation was announced by **Yury Selivanov** on Twitter.

    description: Asynchronous web framework to build event-based, non-blocking Python web applications. It is inspired by Flask, ASP.NET Core, and the work of Yury Selivanov. BlackSheep includes a web framework and an HTTP client implementation, and is ASGI compatible. Originally it included an HTTP Server implementation and performed well in the last round of benchmarks from TechEmpower. However, the decision to separate the web framework and make it compatible with ASGI servers is beneficial, as it enables focusing on relatively high-level features. Two project templates for MVC architecture and empty APIs are provided in dedicated repositories.

      The owners of EdgeDB wanted to hire me full-time, but I couldn't adapt to working with them because of the significant time difference.
      During my 8 months at EdgeDB I learned extensively about Python, made contributions to the EdgeDB codebase to implement typing coverage,
      and implemented a CLA Bot for their GitHub organization using the Next.js web framework, TypeScript, and EdgeDB.
