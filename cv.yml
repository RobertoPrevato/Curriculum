projects:
  - name: BlackSheep
    description: Asynchronous web framework to build event based, non-blocking Python web applications. It is inspired by Flask, ASP.NET Core, and the work by Yury Selivanov. BlackSheep includes a web framework and an implementation of HTTP client, and is ASGI compatible. Originally it included an implementation of HTTP Server, and performed well in the last round of benchmarks from TechEmpower. However, the decision of separating the web framework and making it compatible with ASGI servers is a good one, as it enables focusing on relatively high level features. Two project templates, for MVC architecture and empty APIs, are provided in dedicated repositories.
