profile:
  - >
    I work as a Cloud Solution Architect in the Cloud Center of Excellence team at
    Demant, a role I was promoted to in February 2022 after serving as Senior DevOps and
    Senior Cloud Developer. In Demant, which is one of the two leading companies in
    hearing healthcare, I've been made responsible for the Azure tenant as a whole -
    meaning that I have the final word in case of disputes regarding governance in our
    Azure tenant. I am also one of the main administrators of our Azure DevOps
    organizations and our GitHub Enterprise account. In August 2023 I personally
    configured the integration between our Entra ID tenant and Demant's GitHub
    Enterprise Managed Users account, along with the most important settings of our
    GitHub account to enable Copilot and Codespaces. In recent months I have worked to
    implement Azure landing zones and the adoption of the enterprise-scale reference
    architecture from Microsoft in Demant, helping to automate tasks such as the
    creation of Azure subscriptions with consistent tagging, Entra ID groups, eligible
    assignments, and role settings for Entra ID Privileged Identity Management. I have
    played a key role in defining Demant's Internal Developer Platform and Platform
    Engineering strategy, contributing to designing features for Azure
    Landing Zones, Azure DevOps, and GitHub Enterprise to enable development teams to
    provision and manage resources independently. I am a key contributor in implementing
    a Cloud Community of Practice in Demant, working on documentation and knowledge
    sharing. For example, I produced documentation and
    examples to describe a recommended strategy for automating deployments to Azure API
    Management. I regularly work on Infrastructure as Code using YAML Pipelines, Bash, Azure CLI, and PowerShell.

    Before my promotion to the Cloud Architect position, I played a key role in building
    several web applications (both front-ends and back-ends) and web APIs for Demant,
    often independently implementing web applications end-to-end. Examples of IT systems
    I developed for Demant using Azure Cloud include: the Signing Service API
    (GxP validated), which is used to create and verify digital signatures for firmware
    at Demant's production sites for hearing devices; the Oticon Medical Software
    Center, a software distribution platform for Oticon Medical integrated with both
    Azure Active Directory (now Entra ID) and Azure AD B2C; and HIQMS (GxP validated), a
    system used to store and share documents for our QMS (Quality Management System). I
    also built a portal to handle CIAM information (Customer Identity and Access
    Management) for hearing care professionals (project name: Demant Admin Tool), web
    APIs to serve localized content for mobile apps used by end customers (project name:
    Account WebFace).

    I am a specialist in web applications, with a deep understanding of HTTP web servers,
    clients, web frameworks, and browsers. I have a generalist profile, with more than 10
    years of experience in building back-ends and front-ends. Web development and coding
    are two of my greatest passions, as demonstrated by my <a
    href="https://github.com/RobertoPrevato">GitHub profile</a> and employment history.


  - >
    During my years as a Senior DevOps and Cloud Developer at Demant, my main
    responsibilities consisted of building back-ends in Azure Cloud, helping to
    define the global governance for our production services, and establishing best practices to
    implement, secure, and publish APIs.

  - >
    I am the author of one of today's most performant web frameworks for Python: <a
    href="https://github.com/Neoteroi/BlackSheep">BlackSheep</a>, as proven by TechEmpower
    benchmarks since its first implementations. This gave me the opportunity to
    work part-time with Łukasz Langa (former Python release manager and Python Core
    Developer) and Yury Selivanov (also a Python Core developer) at EdgeDB. The position
    at EdgeDB lasted only 8 months, in 2020, while I was still working full-time for Demant.

  - >
    During my work at EdgeDB I implemented a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) bot
    for GitHub, which is now also used by the Python Software Foundation. The source
    code is available on GitHub in the EdgeDB organization. The adoption of the CLA bot by
    the Python Software Foundation was announced by Yury Selivanov on Twitter.

  - >
    When building back-ends at work, I primarily code with C# and Microsoft technologies.
    When coding in my free time, my favorite programming language is Python and my
    platform of choice is Ubuntu.

  - >
    When creating new front-ends, I build single-page applications. My technology of
    choice today is Vue.js with TypeScript and Vite. In the past I also used Angular,
    React, Knockout.js, Ember, Backbone with Require.js, Webpack, Grunt, and Gulp. Before
    Node.js was first published in 2009, I was already building front-ends using jQuery
    and plain JavaScript.

  - >
    The reason I live in Poland is that I was hired from Italy to work on the new
    internet banking platform for mBank. I was hired by Accenture and Avanade because I created a
    Tetris web application in HTML and JavaScript, and I was considered an expert in
    JavaScript.

desired_position: >-
  Cloud Architect. Contributing to APIs, DevOps, and Cloud
  governance. Possibility to work with my favorite technologies: Azure, Python, C#,
  TypeScript.

    description: Asynchronous web framework to build event-based, non-blocking Python web applications. It is inspired by Flask, ASP.NET Core, and the work of Yury Selivanov. BlackSheep includes a web framework and an HTTP client implementation, and is ASGI compatible. Originally it included an HTTP Server implementation and performed well in the last round of benchmarks from TechEmpower. However, the decision to separate the web framework and make it compatible with ASGI servers is beneficial, as it enables focusing on relatively high-level features. Two project templates for MVC architecture and empty APIs are provided in dedicated repositories.
